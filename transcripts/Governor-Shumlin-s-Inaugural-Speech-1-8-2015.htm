    <p><span><a data-m="1300" class="thewords">&#x5b;applause&#x5d; Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="48000" class="thewords">Thank you.  That Kurn Hattin crowd&#x27;s a tough act to follow, and I&#x27;ve just got to say on a personal note, my beautiful daughters are here, and their grandmother, who passed away a month ago, grew up at Kurn Hattin with her brothers and sister.  So it&#x2019;s special tribute, special moment for me that they were able to knock it out of the park, as kids from Windham County do.  So, thank you, Kurn Hattin.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="74300" class="thewords">&#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="82700" class="thewords">And thank you all for making it possible for me to give this speech today. &#x5b;laughter&#x5d;  I&#x27;m humbled, I&#x27;m grateful.  I can&#x27;t tell you how much it means to me from the bottom of my heart.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="98000" class="thewords">Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, members of the general assembly, Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished guests, fellow Vermonters, thank you for the tremendous honor and opportunity to serve again as your governor.  As a Vermonter who grew up, raised my daughters and built two businesses here, it&#x2019;s the greatest privilege of my life to give back to the state that has given me so much.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="129800" class="thewords">I love serving as governor because I love Vermont.  I have worked hard as governor to improve life for Vermonters in these still difficult times.  I was elected four years ago on a commitment not to shy away &#x2014; not to shy away &#x2014; from tough decisions.  Since then, we&#x27;ve made real progress on the big challenges facing our state &#x2014; growing jobs, bolstering early childhood education and college affordability, raising wages for minimum wage workers, stemming our opiate addiction epidemic, retiring Vermont Yankee and pursuing a cleaner, greener energy future&#x3b;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="177000" class="thewords">Rebuilding our downtowns together, our mental health system, our state office building at Waterbury and beyond, and our crumbling roads and bridges&#x3b; balancing four consecutive budgets without raising income, sales and rooms and meals tax rates.  I&#x27;m extremely proud of the work that we have done together on these issues and so many others, to make Vermont a better place to live, to work, to raise a family.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="208900" class="thewords">And I thank you for your partnership, your partnership in making that happen.  It&#x2019;s also clear that we have much more work left to do.  At a time in America where the gap between those who have great wealth and everybody else is larger than at any time since before the Depression, too many Vermonters are still struggling to get ahead, with bills piling up and the deck stacked against them.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="241600" class="thewords">With health care costs and education spending eating up incomes faster than Vermonters can pull it in, we owe it to them to control spiraling health care costs, address property taxes, keep growing jobs and expanding opportunity and expanding businesses.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="261300" class="thewords">I heard clearly in the election this fall that Vermonters expect more from me and from this state to help improve their lives.  From jobs to the environment, I have an agenda for progress that I&#x27;ll partner with you to fulfill in this term and beyond.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="282100" class="thewords">That agenda is rooted in the abundance of hope that I have for Vermont&#x27;s future, and my sincerest belief that our best days are ahead of us, not behind us. &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="305800" class="thewords">Now, because of the enormity of issues that Vermonters have called upon us to tackle in this biennium &#x2014; you&#x27;ve heard them, I&#x27;ve heard &#x27;em &#x2014; my agenda for progress will be presented in two parts.  Next week, I&#x27;ll deliver my budget address.  This is the hardest budget I&#x27;ve had to create.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="326200" class="thewords">And it will take a balanced approach to bring our state&#x27;s funding in line with future revenue projections.  I know that economic growth, affordability, and strong quality of life are the surest ways to help Vermonters prosper.  I&#x27;ll address next week critical policy areas where we can help move the dial for struggling Vermonters and bolster our quality of life, including workforce development, educational quality and spending, health care, child protection, and continuing our progress with drug addiction.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="366000" class="thewords">But today, in part one of my policy presentation to you, I&#x27;m gonna focus on initiatives also absolutely critical to working Vermonters: Our economic prosperity and our special quality of life in two related areas: Energy and the environment.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="385200" class="thewords">We know what makes Vermont the best place in America.  We all know it.  Without our mountains, hills and valleys, our farms, streams, lakes and forests, remote, quiet and rooted in rugged marble, slate and granite, Vermont would be just another place to live.  Our natural habitat binds Vermonters tightly to our state.  It&#x2019;s what inspires others to put roots down here.  Ask Ben and Joanna Kinnaman, who moved from Baltimore to the Richmond area.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="424100" class="thewords">The Kinnamans came to Vermont, started their deep sea robotics business, Green Sea Systems.  Like so many small entrepreneurs all over our state who sustain us, the Kinnamans could&#x27;ve built their business in any state in the nation.  But Vermont&#x27;s people, quality of life, and environment beckoned them, and they now employ 14 people, and test their products in Lake Champlain.  They believed in Vermont as the best place to live, to work, to grow a family and to grow a business.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="458600" class="thewords">The Kinnamans are here today.  Thank you, Ben and Joanna, for investing in Vermont.  Stand up if you would, let&#x27;s give you a hand.  &#x5b;applause&#x5d; Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="479000" class="thewords">Now, there are countless other entrepreneurs like the Kinnamans who choose to stay or come here for our environment and our quality of life.  That&#x27;s why they come.  And there are thousands of Vermonters whose livelihoods are tied to our green economy.  Just as in the last century, when a new economic boom was created by chainsaw&#x2d;toting pioneers carving ski trails into the green mountains, we now see a new wave of pioneering and innovators and job creators, in those who are now powering Vermont forward in the renewable energy industry.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="522200" class="thewords">We can also see Vermont&#x27;s future in our beloved Lake Champlain, which drives tourism and supports our economy even as it cries out for us to do more, to stop dumping pollutants that are destroying it before our eyes.  We know that everything we hold precious is under threat from climate change and pollution.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="547700" class="thewords">Time and again, since I&#x27;ve been governor, we&#x27;re borne witness together to the destructive power of extreme weather on our homes, our businesses, farmland, roads and bridges.  This extreme rain and flooding have also worsened our water pollution problems &#x2014; made &#x27;em much, much worse, hastening all that is undermining the beauty and the health of our lake.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="574100" class="thewords">Now, no one knows better than Vermonters how to turn a challenging adversity like climate change into opportunity.  That&#x27;s what we do best.  Just look at our burgeoning green energy industry.  Throughout Vermont, innovation and collaboration, partnering with creative public policy regulation, we&#x27;re pioneering the development and deployment of locally generated low&#x2d;carbon energy, creating jobs and putting money in Vermonters&#x27; pockets while we do it.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="608500" class="thewords">Yesterday&#x27;s huge power plants, far away out there somewhere, connected to us by miles and miles of poles and wires, will be supplanted by tomorrow&#x27;s integrated microgrid, with community&#x2d;scaled renewable energy systems powering our smart green homes and businesses.  That&#x27;s the future.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="629100" class="thewords">And guess what&#x3f; &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="641200" class="thewords">And that tomorrow is happening today right here in Vermont.  The Borkowski Family of Rutland recently became Green Mountain Power&#x27;s first e&#x2d;home customer, working with the company to complete a radical transformation of their older home, virtually eliminating their need for heating oil &#x2014; gone &#x2014; while cutting their electric use in half.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="667600" class="thewords">They now have a comfortable, super&#x2d;insulated, and affordable home.  Solar panels on their roof feed electronics in the garage, including storage for cloudy days, all of which power heat pumps that warm and cool their home and provide hot water while it&#x2019;s at it.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="688300" class="thewords">NeighborWorks, Efficiency Vermont, and others partnered helping on this project, supporting local jobs while they did it.  The Borkowskis financed the project right on their own electric bill, allowing savings to match or exceed their loan payments.  I enjoyed visiting their home with Vermont&#x27;s congressional delegation and US Secretary of Energy Moniz.  Mark and Sara Borkowski are here today, and I want to recognize them for being two of Vermont&#x27;s energy pioneers.  Mark and Sara, stand up so we can give you a shoutout.  &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="723000" class="thewords">Thank you for your &#x5b;business&#x5d;.  &#x5b;applause&#x5d; Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="734500" class="thewords">And no one&#x27;s clapping harder than Mary Powell.  You know, the Borkowskis remind us that our small, rural state has all the ingredients needed to claim the mantel of the nation&#x27;s energy innovation leader, moving beyond dependence on wildly priced, dirty fossil fuels, and helping our environment while spurring economic development, building jobs, saving energy dollars, and improving the lives of Vermonters. &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="767100" class="thewords">That&#x27;s, that&#x27;s... &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="776200" class="thewords">It takes innovative entrepreneurs, research and technical training at our state colleges and University of Vermont, progressive utility leaders, which don&#x27;t exist in every state, but we got them in Vermont &#x2014; thousands of committed Vermonters volunteering on energy committees at the local levels in over 100 towns, 100 towns and villages.  Together, we&#x27;re making Vermont the energy innovation leader nationwide. &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="811100" class="thewords">Now, doing even more to seize the opportunity of Vermont&#x27;s energy leadership by investing more deeply in energy research and development will pay dividends for our colleges and universities.  And I call upon them to help us lead these efforts with even more vigor.  We are perfectly positioned to make this vision a reality together.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="838600" class="thewords">We have a solid regulatory system, willing and forward&#x2d;thinking utility and energy companies, a statewide transmission company, benefiting our ratepayers, in VELCO, and the nation&#x27;s first statewide efficiency utility, Efficiency Vermont.  With this foundation, we also have innovations by Vermont&#x27;s entrepreneurs at companies like Dynapower in South Burlington, which participated with the Department of Energy on the first in the nation microgrid project, built on a landfill, fueled by solar and battery storage.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="874100" class="thewords">Companies like Catamount Solar in Randolph, AllEarth Renewables in Williston, Solaflect, Norwich, and many others, are developing, manufacturing and deploying solar systems, creating clean energy innovations all over Vermont, helping Vermonters go green and save energy dollars.  &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="905200" class="thewords">SunCommon of Waterbury Center is making solar more accessible for homeowners from all income levels &#x2014; all income levels &#x2014; and providing good jobs for young people who want to stay right here in the state of Vermont and make a good living.  Look at Dayton Brown: Born and raised here, attended Vermont Tech for engineering, joined the Vermont Air National Guard, serving a tour of duty in Afghanistan.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="932300" class="thewords">He&#x27;s now making a life for himself and his family, working for SunCommon.  His coworker, Graham Fisk, a solar advisor for the company, came to Vermont to attend Middlebury, and after leaving for a time for the big city, saw the lack of wisdom in his ways, came back to Vermont, because we called him back, Vermont called him back.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="954300" class="thewords">Dayton and Graham, I know you&#x27;re here today.  Where are you hiding&#x3f;  Stand up, we need ya.  &#x5b;applause&#x5d;  Thank you.  Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="971000" class="thewords">Thank you for playing for the home team&#x3b; it matters.  Now, it&#x2019;s not just clean energy businesses that grow as a result of Vermont&#x27;s energy pioneering.  When AllEarth Renewables needs components for its solar trackers, guess what&#x3f;  It turns to businesses like the one I visited last summer &#x2014; NSA Industries up in St. Johnsbury.  NSA is primarily a metal fabricator and a machining manufacturer, and they&#x27;re now a vibrant part of the solar supply chain.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1002000" class="thewords">Or look at Faraday in Middlebury that was awarded &#x24;1 million from the Department of Energy to develop smart solar map&#x2d;based tools.  Each of these companies is creating jobs, attracting highly trained employees, and helping Vermont position as the energy innovation leader while we keep young people in this state. &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1032700" class="thewords">Now, the policies that you helped put in place over the last few years spurred Vermont&#x27;s success.  Make no mistake about it.  We significantly expanded net metering.  We supported a solar incentive, which leveraged up to eight dollars of private investment for every state dollar.  And we more than doubled, we doubled the size of our renewable energy standard offer program, while simultaneously using the power of the market to cut the price of solar by approximately 60&#x25;.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1067300" class="thewords">This has fostered a clean energy sector that has created over 15,000 jobs for Vermonters &#x2014; 15,000 jobs since we started this out.  It has enabled us to build and deploy more than five times the amount of local solar on the grid now than on my first day in office, making Vermont &#x2014; that&#x27;s right, five times... &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1098800" class="thewords">Making Vermont number one in the nation for solar jobs per capita, and helping us sustain one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country. &#x5b;applause&#x5d;  It&#x2019;s a good deal.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1114500" class="thewords">Now, at the same time, when some of our neighboring states have seen breathtaking increases in electric rates &#x2014; I read in the paper, some of the businesses in New Hampshire last week complaining about 100&#x25; increases &#x2014; we&#x27;ve accomplished all this while our largest utility cut rates by 2.46&#x25; last year.  Our rates are going down, our neighbors&#x27; rates are going up &#x5b;applause&#x5d;, we&#x27;re getting this right.  &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1145800" class="thewords">Now, we should be proud of our progress, but we can and we must do more.  Today I&#x27;m proposing that we take the next bold step together.  An Energy Innovation Program that will drive our economy in the next decade and beyond.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1164900" class="thewords">This Energy Innovation Program will replace the SPEED program that&#x27;s set to expire in 2017 with smart, forward&#x2d;thinking renewable electricity targets for Vermont&#x27;s utilities.  Now, our proposal is not just a copycat RPS that forces us to buy more costly renewable electricity without an eye towards lowering overall costs for Vermonters who are already struggling to pay their bills.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1193300" class="thewords">That&#x27;s not what it does.  Instead, our Energy Innovation Program will promote clean energy and less expensive total energy cost for Vermonters by putting a priority on improving countless more homes across Vermont, like the Borkowskis, and adding hundreds of megawatts of new, community&#x2d;scale, locally generated, clean energy to our portfolio. &#x5b;applause&#x5d;  That&#x27;s what it&#x2019;ll do.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1229500" class="thewords">In addition to the e&#x2d;home project, we have many other examples of pilots and partnerships that the Energy Innovation Program will help encourage, from Vermont Electric&#x27;s community solar projects, to Stowe Electric&#x27;s vehicle recharging project, to Washington Electric&#x27;s solar water discount, to Burlington Electric&#x27;s smart energy saving programs.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1256100" class="thewords">We got lots of examples of what&#x2019;s working.  This new program will create over 1,000 additional jobs, put money in Vermonters&#x27; pockets, will a net savings of hundreds of millions of dollars on energy bills going forward, and cut greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 15 million metric tons through 2032, helping us achieve nearly a quarter of the greenhouse gas emission reductions we need to get in order to meet our 2050 goal.  Now, that&#x27;s a big deal. &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1296600" class="thewords">If we work together to enact this legislation, it&#x2019;ll mark our single biggest step so far towards reaching our climate and renewable energy goals.  Jobs, energy savings and emission reductions make this program a true win for our economy, and for our environment.  I ask that you support this concept during this legislative session&#x3b; let&#x27;s get it done together.  &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1333600" class="thewords">Innovative energy projects can also help with another pressing problem: water equality.  In St. Albans Bay, locals are developing several new manure digesters designed to take waste from up to ten farms in the region &#x2014; so they&#x27;re all doing this together.  They generate energy for the farm, and they sell the byproduct, saving money, while diverting many tons of farm waste that could overwhelmed end up polluting Lake Champlain.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1367000" class="thewords">Projects like this are so important because we&#x27;re rapidly losing the battle for clean water.  We are losing it.  We love our rivers.  We love our lakes.  From Lake &#x5b;Mafermadog&#x5d; to the Battenkill, from the Lamoille River to Lake Bomoseen, from Otter Creek to the river that I grew up on, The Connecticut.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1392100" class="thewords">And we all revere our crown jewel, Lake Champlain, which supports hundreds of millions of dollars in economic activity every single year.  Protecting Lake Champlain, make no mistake about it, means protecting Vermont&#x27;s economy.  &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1422600" class="thewords">Anyone who spent time on Lake Champlain this past season experienced firsthand the heartbreaking reality that it&#x2019;s suffering now more than ever.  To see and to smell the massive blue&#x2d;green algae blooms at St. Albans Bay or in nearby Lake Carmi, and to hear the pain and the frustration in the voices of homeowners and businesses who have patiently waited for cleaner and clearer water, it&#x2019;s simply devastating.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1457700" class="thewords">Legislative action is critical.  It&#x2019;s critical.  But you cannot go it alone.  Families, business owners, local officials, anglers, farmers, community members from every corner of our state are working to find solutions to clean up our waters.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1475600" class="thewords">We&#x27;re inspired and informed by the efforts of community groups like the Friends of Northern Lake Champlain, the Lewis Creek Association, and the Franklin Watershed Committee for Lake Carmi.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1490400" class="thewords">You also have the support of local leaders like my friend and former seatmate, David Dean of the Connecticut River Watershed, Denise Smith, and business owners like the Tylers of Tyler Place, and Bob Beach of the Basin Harbor Club.  Organizations like the Lake Champlain Regional Chamber of Commerce have spoken forcefully about the need for strong action, and business community support to protect our lake.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1519000" class="thewords">Farmers like Tim Magnant in Franklin, and Brian Kemp in Salisbury, are showing that it&#x2019;s possible to use innovative, practical and cost&#x2d;effective solutions to the problems of pollution on our farms.  I know Tim and Brian are here today as well as Denise and Marty Illick from Lewis Creek and Alicia Sawyer from Franklin Watershed Committee.  Stand up, let&#x27;s give you a hand for all you&#x27;re doing together.  &#x5b;applause&#x5d; Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1551600" class="thewords">You&#x27;re getting it right.  Thank you.  &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1563800" class="thewords">Now, this collaboration is matched by the exceptional leadership of our congressional delegation.  Thanks to the efforts of what I call the Saint of Lake Champlain, Senator Leahy, and Senator Sanders, Congressman Welch, the federal government is committing millions and millions of dollars in additional funds to help achieve our clean water goals.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1588700" class="thewords">I am also your partner.  I&#x27;ve asked my cabinet to implement the Lake Champlain Restoration Plan we submitted to the EPA last spring &#x2014; the most comprehensive and strategic effort yet undertaken by the State of Vermont to protect and restore our waters.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1608800" class="thewords">Reasonable people, frustrated people will ask how is our plan different and better than past efforts&#x3f;  How&#x27;s it different&#x3f;  What we&#x27;ve learned is that if we use the data to target the greatest resources &#x2014; and we now have the data &#x2014; to the greatest source of pollution, to get the greatest return on our money, we can make real progress.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1633000" class="thewords">Now, should the EPA reject our plan &#x2014; and you gotta know this &#x2014; we know that the measures that they would require us to do would be more costly and less targeted than the plan that we have laid out for ourselves.  We know the biggest contributors to our water quality problems.  It is no mystery to us.  40&#x25; from farm runoff, 20&#x25; from roads and developed lands.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1663500" class="thewords">We also know the largest pollution sources that we should address first and where they are located, and that&#x27;s what&#x2019;s different about our approach.  Now, if the EPA doesn&#x2019;t approve our plan, we would lose the flexibility to target our biggest problems first, and instead have to spend hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars on the limited areas where federal law gives the EPA direct authority.  So they&#x27;ve got a limited scope.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1692300" class="thewords">Guess what&#x3f;  It&#x2019;s upgrading our municipal water plants.  Even though pollution from these plants only contributes to about three percent &#x2014; three percent &#x2014; of our Lake Champlain water quality problems.  That&#x27;s foolish.  That&#x27;s foolish.  That doesn&#x2019;t meet the Vermont common sense test.  So let me tell you the three things that we need to accomplish:</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1718600" class="thewords">First, with your support, we&#x27;ll help towns meet their obligation to properly maintain roads and prevent runoff leading to erosion, which&#x27;ll keep nutrients and sediments out of the water.  We&#x27;ll help them implement modern storm water management systems that capture and treat the polluted runoff from dirt roads, streets and parking lots.  Second, most of our hardworking farmers and loggers, they want to do the right thing&#x3b; they&#x27;re Vermonters.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1751600" class="thewords">Because they care about Vermont and they recognize that our fish and farm and land use practices will often save them a ton of money in the long run.  But they sometimes need financial help to make the improvements required.  So we&#x27;re gonna direct significant new resources to help them reduce water pollution from their operations.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1774100" class="thewords">We will also work harder to keep livestock out of our streams and seek more careful management and tilling practices in manure applications.  Those are critical.  With the help of Attorney General Sorrell, we&#x27;ll redouble our effort to enforce existing water quality regulations, so that the good work of so many is not undone by a few. &#x5b;applause&#x5d; We gotta do that.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1812900" class="thewords">Third, I&#x27;m gonna ask you to help me hold the farms that have not been doing the right thing more accountable, by adding teeth to our current use program.  Similar to the way we treat foresters &#x2014; and we do this now &#x2014; farmers who are not following the required practices that prevent pollution should not enjoy the property tax reductions that current use gives them, and until they finish the work or complete the work that is required of them. &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1854300" class="thewords">Now, we all know that it&#x2019;ll take some patience, it&#x2019;ll take some time to make these changes, but it&#x2019;ll also take money.  Money.  Therefore, my capital budget will include &#x24;6.75 million for technical assistance and direct investment in water quality projects around the state. &#x5b;applause&#x5d; That&#x27;s right.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1883900" class="thewords">This includes &#x24;1.6 million in state match, which&#x27;ll leverage &#x24;8.2 million in federal EPA grants, for a total of &#x24;9.8 million, for low interest loans to municipalities, and an increase to &#x24;3.75 million funding for innovative storm water management practices, and &#x24;1.4 million for the agency of ag&#x27;s cost sharing program for livestock fencing and other measures that will help our farmers get it right.  &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1921200" class="thewords">My transportation bill also includes &#x24;3.2 million for projects that reduce polluted runoff from our back roads, and that too is critical.  &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1937600" class="thewords">Now, I also ask that you maintain funding for the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board even in this difficult budget year, to help support farms and forestry operations, to improve water quality as we conserve working forests, farmland and important natural habitats.  &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1965900" class="thewords">In order to ramp up our clean water efforts, I&#x27;m also establishing the Vermont Clean Water Fund, and proposing funding sources designed to raise an additional &#x24;5 million this year alone to strengthen significantly our water quality efforts through two mechanisms:</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1985200" class="thewords">First, we&#x27;ll propose a fee on agricultural fertilizer because these products contribute to water pollution.  This&#x27;ll raise approximately &#x24;1 million a year to improve our ability to address farm practices, to give the farmers the money they need to do the job.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2002400" class="thewords">Second, we&#x27;ll ask owners of commercial land and industrial parcels within the Champlain Watershed for an impact payment.  The annual payment will be modest, amounting to &#x24;100 or &#x24;200 for a typical large commercial parcel.  Now, we&#x27;re not asking for payment from hard&#x2d;pressed homeowners who are already struggling to pay their property taxes.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2027000" class="thewords">The Vermont Clean Water Fund will be structured so that it can serve as a repository, a repository for additional federal and private funding sources.  While dedicated state revenues are needed to help this effort, guess what&#x3f;  We cannot go it alone.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2047300" class="thewords">I have begun soliciting private donations to The Vermont Clean Water Fund, and I&#x27;m very pleased to announce that Keurig Green Mountain, a company that depends upon clean water, and has made significant clean water investments worldwide, has generously agreed to donate &#x24;5 million over the next five years for Vermont water quality stewardship projects right here in the state of Vermont. &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2095200" class="thewords">Now, working in partnership with scientists from UVM and &#x5b;Limatech&#x5d;, the Keurig funds will support projects right here in the state that launched their extraordinary success.  A company that we&#x27;re all extremely proud of.  I want to thank my friend, Keurig CEO Brian Kelley, whose Chief Sustainability Officer, Monique Oxender, is here today, for Keurig&#x27;s vision, commitment, that will pay dividends for Vermont&#x27;s Lake Champlain and our waters for years to come.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2127500" class="thewords">Thank you, Monique.  Where are you&#x3f;  Stand up.  Thank you, Keurig, thank you, Green Mountain.  &#x5b;applause&#x5d; We are truly grateful.  &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2144700" class="thewords">And let me tell you something, Monique &#x2014; I think Keurig&#x27;s generosity and focus on the importance of water quality will inspire other businesses, other individuals, to aid our efforts for Vermont Clean Water Fund.  Thank you so much.  &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2165900" class="thewords">With plenty of frustration with our progress on water quality, Vermonters have also lost patience with finger pointing about who&#x27;s to blame.  When you talk to &#x27;em, most of &#x27;em are sick of it.  We must all take our share of responsibility and work together across the divides that can exist among advocates, businesses, farmers, neighbors, government, who else, to get the job done, &#x27;cause this one belongs to all of us.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2200200" class="thewords">I need your support to ensure that the state of Vermont does its part, and I look forward to working with you this session to launch a new era of clean water in Vermont.  Let&#x27;s do it.  &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2225600" class="thewords">Yeah, that&#x27;s the spirit&#x21;  &#x5b;applause, cheers&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2243600" class="thewords">Now, thank you because you know as well as I that this will be part of our collective legacy if we can get it right, and the time to act is now.  You know, there isn&#x27;t a Vermonter, there is not a Vermonter who doesn&#x2019;t love this great state, who doesn&#x2019;t cherish its special quality of quality of life, who doesn&#x2019;t hope, who doesn&#x2019;t hope for its future.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2275900" class="thewords">To strengthen and sustain Vermont&#x27;s future, we must grow our economy and ensure that Vermonters live in an affordable state with access to good, well&#x2d;paying jobs.  It&#x2019;s a competitive world out there.  Other states are offering millions of dollars of tax breaks to lure companies to their borders &#x2014; I don&#x27;t know why anyone would want to live there &#x2014; but there are things that the little state of Vermont has that cannot be duplicated, that they can&#x27;t copy.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2309900" class="thewords">It&#x2019;s our natural beauty, it&#x2019;s our clean air, it&#x2019;s our rural nature.  It&#x2019;s our resilient, innovative, and entrepreneurial people.  These represent our competitive strengths, and they&#x27;re treasured parts of our economic engine that we must protect, nurture and grow together.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2330700" class="thewords">I hope you&#x27;ll agree that the proposals that I&#x27;ve outlined today will help us do just that together. &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2350200" class="thewords">Next week I&#x27;ll continue to outline my agenda to grow our economy and protect our quality of life in areas including educating spending and quality, which voters have asked of us, job training, health care progress.  I&#x27;ll also present to you a balanced budget.  In the long term we all know economic growth is the key to our state&#x27;s success.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2377900" class="thewords">We cannot simply cut our way out of our fiscal challenges year after year, taking away services that are so important to many Vermonters, nor can we tax our way out of all of our problems.  Instead, we must meet the challenge to match state spending to our economic growth while working to increase that growth in the years ahead for the health of Vermont&#x27;s future.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2407400" class="thewords">I look forward to a productive term working together with you on what is best for the Vermont that we all love so much.  Thank you for the honor of making me governor today.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  &#x5b;applause, cheers, whistles&#x5d;</a></span></p>
